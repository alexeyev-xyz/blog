There were holes in the elbows and just one button remained, but from this, Nanny was sure something else could be made. So she started to sew on that cold winter’s night, and Boofle was born, much to the children’s delight. Boofle was all that a snugglesome pup should be, lovable and cuddly and best friend to you and me.</span></h6>
